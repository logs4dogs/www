> Protocols will help you to establish a basic fundement in your training program. 
> Its like the pieces of a puzzle.


### 1. What is your end goal?
Visualize what you want to achieve1? How does the behavior look like?
Can you describe the exact behavior like you saw it on a slow motion video in front of you?

### 2. Break it down in small steps
Break down the total behavior in small steps. Like learning to write.
You start 'writing individual letters'
until you can write words and story's.
We first train all the indivdual small parts of the behavior and bring it together when the parts are strong

### 3. Set clear criteria for dog and trainer
You get what you reinforce so make sure you only reinforce what you want. Describe the exact behavior that you will reinforce. Make it so clear that anyone, also non trainers can understand when they need to reinforce the animal and when not.

### 4. Write down your training steps
Make a plan before you actually start to train. Write down in a clear way what you are going to do! Ask others to check if its clear enough. If a human don't understand it, then it will be to difficult for the dog!



### 5. Training sessions
Each step (see 2) will be described as a session. Many sessions will form a protocol. As example a SIT protocol will
have several sessions. Like SIT for 2 seconds on 2 meter distance untill the dog can SIT for 30 sec when the trainer is 50 meter away and out of sight.

### 6. Trials in a session
Each session will have multiple trials or better to say rehearsels. We like to keep our training sessions short like 10 repetitions or max 2 minutes of training. This make sure you can see progress and its fun for the dog.

### 7. Data
When you split training into sessions and each session into trials you can collect data. Calculate the reinforcements and repetitions. Make sure the rate of reinforcement stays high!

### 8. Move on after 2x 80%
If a session of 10 trials will give you 8 or more reinforcements you score 80%. You are almost ready to move to the next session. Score 2x 80% and make it a bit more difficult for the dog.

### 9. Evaluation
Where your protocols, sessions and trials good enough? Was your dog happy and quickly progressing to the next session? If not, adjust the sessions. Check your rate of reinforcement as guideline.
